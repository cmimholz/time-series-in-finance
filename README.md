  - `added_users.csv`: Unique user data.
  - `media_ids.csv`: A list of unique media IDs (songs or tracks).
  - `test_dataset.csv`: Test dataset used to evaluate the model's performance.
  - `train_dataset.csv`: Training dataset used to train the recommendation model.
  - `validation_dataset.csv`: Validation dataset used to tune the model.
  
- **best_model.keras**: The best-trained model saved in Keras format for further use.
- **eda.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and distributions within the dataset.
- **recommender.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook that implements the recommendation algorithm and evaluates its performance.
